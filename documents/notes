- IssueDate is not present in many grant files
- Some tables are completely empty.. what about csv files
- Applications have r1-r2 etc, and how are those processed? / what are they?  revision files?
- are they complete revision files?  How to deal with them?
- has ipgb20190813_wk33 been failing processing?
- yes Database bulk load query failed,the table was locked. So, this needs to have try catch + loop to keep trying until processed.

- Database bulk load query failed - this is not looped, and fails due to timeout
- Failed to bulk load grant data for

- Look for MySQL exception types in Python
- If it's a table lock condition, don't add 1 to the failed attempts counter
- then the file will never have to be reprocessed due to table lock timeouts

- Should all previous attempt database records be cleared before ANY files are started to process
- every time the processor starts, to avoid the traffic-jam of clearing the database during normal
- processing operations?

- need to prevent the removal of previous attempts from failing, remove the counter based return on fail

- can move the insertion of a file_name into STARTED_FILES until after the file is finished processing
- if bulk insertion is being used, and also move the cleaning of the database until after the file
- has been processed

- Error in the spacing of contatenated lines of the abstract
